# DemoBot(A Bunch Of Projects)

This is a bunch of projects, currently unfinished, and will turn private when close to finish.
This repo is made from a template which you can use to create a Discord bot very
easily using the [Discordeno library](https://github.com/discordeno/discordeno).

IMPLEMENT USER SUGGESTION COMMAND (Introduce ImageScript)üåì(Use Imagescript for card creation instead.)

INTRODUCING IMAGESCRIPT

- MAKE CARD TEMPLATE
- IMPLEMENT CARD TEMPLATE + IMAGE INTO CARD CREATION
- STORE CARD TEMPLATE IN LOCAL FOLDER
- MAKE PROFILE TEMPLATE FOR PROFILE COMMAND
- DISPLAY LEVEL PROGRESS FOR PROFILE COMMAND

MAKE FIGHTING AUTO-GENERATED ENEMIES FOR ENDLESS ONSLAUGHT/STORY (TO-DO BEFORE DOING)

- Add Type Of Card Into DataBase.‚úî
- Give Users Card Command/ Function.‚úî
- Data Pagination Command Of Inventory.‚úî
- Scale cards by level (by card default numbers, attack type, and rarity) *If rarity is high, scaling is high. *If attack type for example is attack, scale attack more than other values.
- Create Card Combining.
- Give Users a way to get cards naturally.
- Make a Daily Shop Of Low-Rare Cards.

How Daily Shop Will Work:

- More Common Cards: Cheaper
- Your Luck Stat Mixed With Level Will grant you rarer rewards very very slowly.

Weekly Shop:

- More Rare Cards But Still Some Common: More Expensive
- Your Luck Stat Mixed With Level Will grant you rarer rewards very very slowly.

Monthly Shop:

- The Most Rare Cards: The Most Expensive.
- Your Luck Stat Mixed With Level Will grant you even rarer cards very very slowly.

How Drops From Dungeons Work:

- You will always gain experience from the dungeon.
- 60/100 Chance to get a card
- Very Rare Chance to gain point reset(Will Figure Out Later)

How Drops From Campaign Work:

- (Will Manually Make Each Campaign. I Kinda Have To)
- You are guaranteed a Card Drop From a Set Of Guaranteed Cards List (Percentages Vary).
- A Specific Amount Of Money.
- You Can Repeat Recently Completed Campaign Levels.

How The Fighting Works:

- Basically Pokemon like system:
- Health is linked to user health stat instead.
- User's Card Type Speed mixed with user-stat-speed will combine. (Example, Using the "Flash" card will mix the cards speed with the users speed, therefore having a use of point-tree.)
- Tank Cards will have low dmg and low Speed but will take the hit of the card being thrown at ${Defense - Attack/Ability}
- Ability Cards Will have High Damage but low speed and low Tank, Therefore. IT's a risk to take.
- Attack Cards Will be the most balance of all 3.
- The Strategy is the user will have to plan out his point tree with his deck he wants to make.
- Tree Resets Will be Offered But Very Rarily.
